(Optional)
To prevent GitHub API rate limiting, you can create a Personal Access Token [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new)
and put it in the `.env.local` file.

```bash
cp .env.local.template .env.local
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

or build and run the preview server:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```
